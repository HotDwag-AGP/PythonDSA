To Build a proper arithmetic calculator using only basics of python!

interface should look like this :

What do you want to do ?
1. Addition
2. Substraction
3. Division
4. Multiplication
5. Exit

When the user enters 1 , the user should be prompted to enter a finite list of numbers

the out put format should be :
  e.g.  22
      + 33
      ------
        55

  SAME FOR ALL OTHER OPERATORS

  IT SHOULD BE A CONTINUOS LOOP UNTIL THE USER DECIDES TO EXIT!
